SI 507 Project 3 by Amanda Jung

In this project, the goal was to write a small Flask application that includes a database to hold data about movies from the files SI507_project3 and requirements.txt.

The file SI507_project3.py encompasses the code for the different parts of our Flask application. For example, it includes code for application configurations, class models (i.e. Movie, Director, & Genre), helper functions for database additions, and different Flask routes with specific set of inputs based on the url.

The file requirements.txt contains the packages (e.g. Flask) that are necessary to run the files of code listed above.
